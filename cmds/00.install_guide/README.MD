## ⚠️ Attention (For Windows Users)

This section is intended for users who are currently on **Windows** and want to install **Ubuntu**.

### 📺 Installation Guide (Video)
The following video provides a complete walkthrough for installing Ubuntu:

- [How to Dual Boot Ubuntu with Windows](https://youtu.be/mXyN1aJYefc?si=Og9ETk9otbZkEXJz)

### ⚠️ Important Note about Secure Boot
In the video, it is suggested to **disable Secure Boot**.  
However, with newer Windows updates (**Windows 11 25H2 and later**), Ubuntu can be dual-booted **without disabling Secure Boot**.

👉 You can safely **skip the Secure Boot disabling step** if your Windows version is **25H2** or above 25H2.

🔍 Want to check your Windows version? Press **Windows + R**, type **winver**, and you’re good to go! A small window will show your version info 🪟

### ✅ After Installation
Once you have successfully installed Ubuntu:
- Finish all installation steps shown in the video
- Boot into Ubuntu
- Then continue with the below link to start with **Update** cmds.
- **[01.system_update](../01.system_update/README.MD)** folder

Good luck, and welcome to Ubuntu 🐧
